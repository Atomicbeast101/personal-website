# Personal Website 
This repo contains the files to build my personal website using the Hugo framework. It was deployed to a web server using my self-hosted Drone CI/CD DevOps pipeline.

Please reach out to [https://adambrodack.com/](https://adambrodack.com/) site if you are interested to see the finished product.
